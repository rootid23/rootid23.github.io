•	Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism
•	Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework
•	Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks
•	Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)
•	Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks

•	All computers are multicore computers, so it is important for you to learn how to extend your knowledge of sequential Java programming to multicore parallelism.
•	Java 7 and Java 8 have introduced new frameworks for parallelism (ForkJoin, Stream) that have significantly changed the paradigms for parallel programming since the early days of Java.
•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.
•	During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and the mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on forums.
