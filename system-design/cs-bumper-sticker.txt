  When in doubt, use brute force. - KT
  If you can’t write it down in English, you can’t code it  - Peter Halpern
  Avoid asymmetry -  Andy Huber
  If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably wrong.  If you have too many special cases, you are doing it wrong.
  Get your data structures correct first, and the rest of the program will write itself.

  "It is faster to make a four-inch mirror then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror."
  Make it work first before you make it work fast
  Whenever possible, steal code.
  Plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery.
