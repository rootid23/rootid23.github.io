-- How to fix

-- The Pregame

  1. Practice under pressure.
    Practice making a fool out of yourself, in a comedy, acting or improv class.

  2. Write about your worries.
      Write down -ve thoughts/Worries every week for about 10 mins (TODO : Get the label ?)
      Find the -ve thought, label them and write down (How you started SBDN?)

  3. Think about yourself differently.

    Asses the game
  1. Mimicry/Chameleon effect
  2. Focus on the positive.
  3. Strategy focus
  4. Medication - Propranolol - Beta-blocker to fix fight-flight response
  5. Think about what to say not what to avoid saying
  6. Minimize the Prefrontal cortex/Cognitive powerhouse/Working memory/Short term memory. as increased usage blocks the
    communication among other areas Solution go to Autopilot mode

-- How to practice
   1. Practice under pressure, in acclimatized environment, eg. Virtual reality practice simulator in Soccer Try to built Alexa Skills
   2. Practice with chess moves -> look for the pattern -> World class chess champion look for the move
   3. Group the pieces of information so you can remember eg. Mnemonic strategy
   4. In the zone practice -> loose self-consciousness eg. Nightouts Hackathon

--  Effect
  1. Practice can alter the inherited traits
  2. Practice, Practice, Practice -> Increase in brain wiring/connection
     during REM sleep so practice daily

-- Evaluation techinique
  FMRI  - Measures O2
  (MRI, EEG, PET not used)

-- Brain scale
  1 thousand neurons - 10^12
-- Facts
Plato (Talent) V/S Aristotle (Practice) -> AIS - AUS team selection use both

-- Test environment
  Pressure simulated by offering money based on performance.

-- Brain
  Prefrontal
    - Develop with age
  Sensory and Motor cortex
    - Kids increased new skill acquistion skills -> eg. Music training, golfing
  Parietal lobe /inferior part
    Numeric + Arithmetic
  Amygdala
    - Emotions useful for reviewing failed attempts

-- Tests
  SAT
  GRE
  AMC
  Raven's Progressive Matrices - Lot of Working Memory -> hold and manipulate images
  Wonderlic Personnel test for NFL
  Trier social stress test for public speaking and interview

-- Brain exercises
  Video Games to improve cognitive ability (1 hour of play -> diminishing returns exists_
  Grand theft
  Half life
  Halo
  Nintendo DS
  Space Fortress - improve memory attention
  Lego - improve spatial ability

-- Juggling - To improve gray matter Eg. London taxi driver -> Navigation

-- Types of memory
  Procedural memory (Step by Step in details) vs Implicit memory (Curse of expertise - Trips up when experts judge the performance of others
  Solved using listening the experience from less experienced people)
  Procedural memory - Focus on how to - Increases choke
  Implicit memory - Focus on what - Goal - Strategy - Reduces Choke - Must do practice
  High working memory - Increased likelihood of missing easy solution -> Solution stalling, Deep breathe, Count 3 backwards| sing a song -> Avoid Overthinking
  Low working memory - Cocktail party effect

-- U-curve
  Optimal pressure is good for gaining the maximum performance.
