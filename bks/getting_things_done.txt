  Utilize flow theory efficiently - mind like water
  Fix procrastination
  Improve Next-project ability
  Overcome anxiety (Chinta -> Chita)
  # of tasks in mind are inversely proportional to tasks done

-- What ?
  Framework to organize, track and review actionable task.

-- How?
  -- 5 Steps

    1. Capture - Find out the next project
            Where to find next project
                  1. Current activities
                  2. Higher horizon
                  3. Current problems
    2. Clarify/Brainstorming - Use the external brain and mind i.e. mind mapping
                 or paper and explore the options and create the tasks

    3. Organize - Create task precedence for execution
    4. Reflect - Make the checklist and put it in the Calender
    5. Engage - Do the work with mind like water/ in the zone approach

  -- 4-3-6 model
    1. 4 point model - To do the tasks in hand.
       Must evaluate
       1. Context
       2. Time available
       3. Energy available
       4. Priority
    2. 3 point model - to do the daily work
        1. Predefined
        2. As it shows up
        3. New defined work
    3. 6 point review model
        1. Purpose (Why?)
        2. Vision
        3. Goals
        4. Area of focus + accountability
        5. Current project
        6. Current action

    -- 2 Min rule
    If task can be done in 2 mins then do it now or else defer or delegate it.


-- Next action
  1. Focus on actionable task
  2. Identify current project + action + Supported material link
  3. Next project + Reference material + Extended brain + mind mapping tool
     Explore all options - Focus on quality not quantity
  4. Do weekly review (It creates loop and enhance the planning ability)
     Tickler monthly/biweekly plan (Non/Digitized) for review
  5. Design workflow aiming to convert it into auto pilot mode
  6. Trashing is important must be done frequently
