-Chunking
Chunking is about forming small mental patterns of meaning relating the material learned to a greater context. These chunks are committed to memory and are easy to retrieve when needed. They unite scattered information into retrievable conceptual units of meaning, so that we can think and perform actions smoothly without going into all the details each time.

-Writing importance
The ancient Greeks were appalled at the idea that one would write down his thoughts and not be able to access that knowledge at any moment. However, writing down our thoughts is an amazing way to expand out memory. We can keep track of our thoughts, how annoying is it when you cannot remember a moment of insight you had at one point. With a limited working memory jot down some notes during the process!!

-Eat
Vitamin B6 improves 5 neurotransmitters,

Serotonin - it's produced in your brain and the foods ingredience won't pass the blood-cerebral barrier. The only way to increase the serotonin would be to eat stone age like, meaning raw, uncooked vegetables (nuts, seeds, beans,..) in lots of little portions during the day, about 50-150 times chewed. But you can at least make sure you have no lack of serotonin by doing sports (especially cardio) and don't drink to much coffee. The brain uses L-Tryptophan to create serotonin and to much coffee prevents this process.
Dopamine -  eat food with omega 3 fatty acids (fish!) and walnuts. Moreover sleep is important, especially before midnight
Epinephrine - food with lots of B-Vitamin Cholin is advisable, e.g. soya products (very good), azuki beans, egg yolk
Norepinephrine
Gama-AminoButyri Acid (GABA)
Bananas have a great amount of B6.

Bloomberg - Never takes break
--- Studies suggest that toxic molecules involved in neurodegenerative disorders accumulate in the space between brain cells. During sleep, a plumbing system called the Glymphatic System open, letting fluid flow rapidly through the brain. The Glymphatic System helps control the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a clear liquid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
Certain brain cells, called glia, control flow through the glymphatic system by shrinking or swelling. Toxic molecules are believed to be involved in neurodegenerative disorders. The accumulation in the space between brain cells is being studied as a cause of many neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s. Sleep can help ward off these toxins that play a negative role in influencing nerve cell communication.
Reference:
Xie et al “Sleep initiated fluid flux drives metabolite clearance from the adult brain.” Science, October 18, 2013. DOI: 10.1126/science.1241224
In the video below, illustrates dye flow through the glymphatic system, a brain "plumbing" system, of a mouse when it was asleep (left) and then, later, when it was awake (right). More dye flowed into the brain during sleep. Results from this study suggest the brain may flush out toxic molecules associated with neurodegenerative disorders during sleep.
